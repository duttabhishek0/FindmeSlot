# FindMeSlot App

Finally, after a long wait, Vaccinations are here!! But wait, isn't it too cumbersome to stand in those long queues and then ultimately get disappointed, cause you didn't get the slot, even after slogging under the sun for so long? Don't worry, when we come in handy to you. I introduce the FindmeSlot application.<br>
The aim of the project is to keep the users updated about the slots of the vaccination centre. Cause finding an empty slot is quite cumbersome this day.
# Purpose
<li>FindmeSlot is an Android application, built with Kotlin.</li><li>The application sole purpose is to get the slots of the vaccination centre available. It asks the user for the PIN code of his/her area, followed by asking the date, on which the user would like to get vaccinated.</li><li> Accordingly, it searches the given PIN code area for available slots. If there are any vaccination centres in the given area, then it is displayed, along with the number of empty slots and the working hours.</li>
